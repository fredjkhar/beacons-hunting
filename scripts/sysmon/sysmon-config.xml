  REQUIRED: Sysmon version 13 or higher (due to changes in syntax and bug-fixes)
	https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon

  NOTE: To collect Sysmon logs centrally for free, see https://aka.ms/WEF | Command to allow log access to the Network Service:
	wevtutil.exe sl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational /ca:O:BAG:SYD:(A;;0xf0005;;;SY)(A;;0x5;;;BA)(A;;0x1;;;S-1-5-32-573)(A;;0x1;;;NS)

  NOTE: Do not let the size and complexity of this configuration discourage you from customizing it or building your own.
	This configuration is based around known, high-signal event tracing, and thus appears complicated, but it is only very
	detailed. Significant effort over years has been invested in front-loading as much filtering as possible onto the
	client. This is to make analysis of intrusions possible by hand, and to try to surface anomalous activity as quickly
	as possible to technicians armed only with Event Viewer. Its purpose is to democratize system monitoring for all organizations.

  NOTE: Sysmon is NOT a whitelist solution or HIDS correlation engine, it is a computer change logging tool.
	Do NOT ignore everything possible. Sysmon's purpose is providing context during a threat or problem investigation. Legitimate
	processes are routinely used by threats - do not blindly exclude them. Additionally, be mindful of process-hollowing / imitation.

  NOTE: By default this monitors DNS, which is extremely noisy. If you are starting out on your monitoring journey, just remove that section.
	You can remove DNS events from Event Viewer screen by applying a 'Filter Current View' for event IDs of: -22
	Additionally, if you want to monitor DNS, you should deploy client-side adblocking to reduce lookups. See the DNS section for info.

  NOTE: This configuration is designed for PER-MACHINE installs of Chrome and OneDrive. That moves their binaries out of user-controlled folders.
	Otherwise, attackers could imitate these common applications, and bypass your logging. Below are silent upgrades you can do, no user impact:
	- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/per-machine-installation
	- https://cloud.google.com/chrome-enterprise/browser/download/
	- As of 2021-02-16 there is no machine-level version of Microsoft Teams. The one provided copies itself to the user profile.

  NOTE: Sysmon is not hardened against an attacker with admin rights. Additionally, this configuration offers an attacker, willing
	to study it, limited ways to evade some of the logging. If you are in a very high-threat environment, you should consider a broader,
	log-most approach. However, in the vast majority of cases, an attacker will bumble through multiple behavioral traps which
	this configuration monitors, especially in the first minutes.

  NOTE: If you encounter unexplainable event inclusion/exclusion, you may have a second Sysmon instance installed under a different exe filename.
	To clear this, try downloading the latest version and uninstalling with -u force. If it hangs, kill the processes and run it again to cleanup.

  TECHNICAL:
  - Run sysmon.exe -? for a briefing on Sysmon configuration.
  - Sysmon XML cannot use the AMPERSAND sign. Replace it with this: &amp;
  - Sysmon 8+ can track which rule caused an event to be logged through the "RuleName" field.
  - If you only specify exclude for a filtering subsection, everything in that subsection is logged by default.
  - Some Sysmon monitoring abilities are not meant for widely deployed general-purpose use due to performance impact. Depends on environment.
  - Duplicate or overlapping "Include" rules do not result in duplicate events being logged.
  - All characters enclosed by XML tags are always interpreted literally. Sysmon does not support wildcards (*), alternate characters, or RegEx.
  - In registry events, the value name is appended to the full key path with a "\" delimiter. Default key values are named "\(Default)"
  - "Image" is a technical term for a compiled binary file like an EXE or DLL. Also, it can match just the filename, or entire path.
  - "ProcessGuid" and "LoginGuid" are not random, they contain some embedded information. https://gist.github.com/mattifestation/0102042160c9a60b2b847378c0ef70b4

  FILTERING: Filter conditions available for use are: is,is not,contains,contains any,contains all,excludes,excludes any,excludes all,begin with,end with,less than,more than,image
  - The "image" filter is usable on any field. Same as "is" but can either match entire string, or only the text after last "\". Credit: @mattifestation
